# react-file-browser
A file browser that shows the directory. It now can do basic file and directory view and multiple file select. 

Here is the [demo](https://qq52184962.github.io/react-file-browser/)

**Unfinished project, but you can still grab the code and build on top of it if you need it.**

### Scripts 
```npm run dev``` to start local development.

```npm run server``` to construct fake server side data. 
(This is credited to [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), you can change db.json to generated different data)

```npm run build``` to build production code.
